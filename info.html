                                                <h4>Friday Night Keynote Speaker</h4>
                                                <p>John Shertzer is the Chief Programs Officer for Kiwanis International and directs all of our Service Leadership Programs, including Key Club International, Circle K International, Builders Club, K-Kids, Aktion Club, and Key Leader. Over 350,000 individuals experience these clubs each year. John’s career has included work in higher education as a university administrator, work with college fraternities and sororities, and leadership and governance consulting for charitable organizations. These experiences have provided him with many opportunities to speak to audiences in 10 different nations and almost every state in the U.S. John believes that through service clubs, young people can develop “service leadership,” which is the powerful force that occurs when a person discovers their heart to serve, answers their call to lead and summons their courage to engage.  This force can be the answer for our world’s greatest challenges. John belongs to the Kiwanis Club of Northwest Indianapolis. He is also leading efforts to start a new elementary school in central Indianapolis that just opened its doors. John is married to Ellen and they have three boys: Jack, Luke, and Ben. At home and work and everywhere in between, John believes that youth should be entrusted with the future and empowered to shape it. There is no stronger advocate for the voice of the coming generation.</p>

He’s passionate about squeezing the juice out of life by creating extraordinary experiences with incredible people. His greatest fear looking back on his life and saying, “I wish I would have…” In 2005, Jon founded the charitable organization Front Row Foundation, which has raised over $500,000 to help people braving life- threatening illnesses get front row seats to the concert or sporting event of their dreams.<p>
